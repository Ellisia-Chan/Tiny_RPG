# Dialogue System Learning Project - Unity

This Unity project is designed to explore and implement different dialogue systems, focusing on creating engaging and interactive conversations within a game environment. It serves as a learning platform for understanding the core components and techniques involved in building robust dialogue systems.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to experiment with various approaches to dialogue design and implementation in Unity.  This includes scripting dialogue flow, managing character interactions, and presenting dialogue to the player in a compelling manner.

## Features (Planned/Implemented)

*   **Scriptable Object-based Dialogue:** Utilizing Scriptable Objects to store and manage dialogue data, allowing for easy editing and organization.
*   **Simple Linear Dialogue:** A basic implementation of a dialogue system that progresses linearly through a conversation.
*   **Branching Dialogue:** Implementing branching dialogue to provide the player with choices that affect the conversation's direction and outcome.
*   **Dialogue UI:** Designing and implementing a user interface to display dialogue text and player choices.
*   **Event-Triggered Dialogue:** Triggering dialogue based on in-game events, such as interacting with a specific object or character.
*   **Quest Integration:** Integrating the dialogue system with the quest system to trigger events and updates based on the players decisions.

## Packages Used

*   **Ink Dialogue System** lightweight scripting language for writing interactive dialogue.
*   **Unity Input System:** New Unity input system
